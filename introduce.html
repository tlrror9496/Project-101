<a>Guernica is a painting about a Nazi bombing in Guernica on April 26, 
1937 during the Spanish Civil War. 
The Spanish Civil War, which began in 1936,
was developed by the Soviet Union and the right by Nazi and Italian support,
devastating the entire region until the Francoists' victory ended in 1939. 
<br><br>
Around 1,500 civilians were killed when the Basque capital of Guernica was bombed by the Nazis.
This is where Picasso was angry.
The fact that not soldiers but civilians were sacrificed in combat.
He will be working on "Guernica" shortly after 
the bombing was reported and will release his first sketch on May 1.<br><br>
The key on the image of Guernica expressed the effect of an explosion</a>
